Oil and Gold are heavily traded commodities and more importantly, there prices determine the economics of the globe. There are several macroeconomic factors which affect the prices which are evidently extremely volatile. These factors are also interdependent, and the relationship between the factors and the prices could also vary, that too sporadically. This makes the prediction of oil and gold prices a very complex and challenging problem.    

But we also know that, the stock markets are the heart of the economic activities of the world. So, what I am hoping to do is to predict Oil and Gold prices from the stock indices performance. And maybe vice, versa too!!!!
